This should be a web app that allows a high-level overview of all devices on a network.
Most importantly, the following attributes shoud be tracked on an ongoing basis: 
    - a count of all online devices and a percentage of total historic online
    - a history of devices that have been replaced/removed
    - total switch count (i.e. 3 devices should be counted for a single stack of 3 switches)
    - Switch neighbors should be detailed in a separate view for traceability
    - image inventory - pie chart showing which devices are on which IOS
    - Some sort of topology view

Additional functionality to view and run STIGs should be added once inventory features are complete
STIGs should be able to be viewed as an overall chart with every (scanned) device combined
STIGs should be able to be sorted by checklist, device type, or device information (i.e. filters for specific device attributes)
STIG checklists should be able to be uploaded from the GUI and stored as specific types. Advanced options should allow older scans
Checklists for each devices should be able to be exported - a signature should be prompted for and inserted on export
